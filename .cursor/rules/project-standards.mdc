# Project Standards

**Single source of truth:** For all project standards (language, issues, commits, development/scaffolding), **read and follow `.github/CLAUDE.md`**. Do not rely on this file alone — CLAUDE.md is what Claude Code uses; Cursor must use it too so both share the same rules with 100% certainty.

For issues and commits, also read the prompts referenced in CLAUDE.md: `.github/prompts/ISSUE_PROMPT.md`, `.github/prompts/COMMIT_PROMPT.md`.
