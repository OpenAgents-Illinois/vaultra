# Development & Scaffolding

**Single source of truth:** For development and scaffolding rules, **read and follow `.github/CLAUDE.md`** (section "Development & Scaffolding"). That file is what Claude Code uses; Cursor must use it too so both share the same rules with 100% certainty.

CLAUDE.md points to:
- `docs/SCAFFOLDING_GUIDE.md` for scaffolding from scratch (phases 1–4)
- `docs/SPECIFICATION_INDEX.md` for task → spec mapping

All spec content lives in `docs/`; read the relevant spec before implementing.
